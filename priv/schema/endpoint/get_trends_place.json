  "description": "Returns the top 50 trending topics for a specific id, if trending information is available for it.\n\nNote: The id parameter for this endpoint is the \"where on earth identifier\" or WOEID, which is a legacy identifier created by Yahoo and has been deprecated. Twitter API v1.1 still uses the numeric value to identify town and country trend locations. Reference our legacy blog post, or archived data\n\nExample WOEID locations include: Worldwide: 1 UK: 23424975 Brazil: 23424768 Germany: 23424829 Mexico: 23424900 Canada: 23424775 United States: 23424977 New York: 2459115\n\nTo identify other ids, please use the GET trends/available endpoint.\n\nThe response is an array of trend objects that encode the name of the trending topic, the query parameter that can be used to search for the topic on Twitter Search, and the Twitter Search URL.\n\nThe most up to date info available is returned on request. The created_at field will show when the oldest trend started trending. The as_of field contains the timestamp when the list of trends was created.\n\nThe tweet_volume for the last 24 hours is also returned for many trends if this is available.",
