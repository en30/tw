If you don't follow a protected user their status will be removed.The order of user IDs or screen names may not match the order of users in the returned array.If a requested user is unknown, suspended, or deleted, then that user will not be returned in the results list.If none of your lookup criteria can be satisfied by returning a user object, a HTTP 404 will be thrown.You are strongly encouraged to use a POST for larger requests.",
