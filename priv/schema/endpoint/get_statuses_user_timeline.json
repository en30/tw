  "description": "Important notice: On June 19, 2019, we began enforcing a limit of 100,000 requests per day to the /statuses/user_timeline endpoint, in addition to existing user-level and app-level rate limits. This limit is applied on a per-application basis, meaning that a single developer app can make up to 100,000 calls during any single 24-hour period.\n\nReturns a collection of the most recent Tweets posted by the user indicated by the screen_name or user_id parameters.\n\nUser timelines belonging to protected users may only be requested when the authenticated user either \"owns\" the timeline or is an approved follower of the owner.\n\nThe timeline returned is the equivalent of the one seen as a user's profile on Twitter.\n\nThis method can only return up to 3,200 of a user's most recent Tweets. Native retweets of other statuses by the user is included in this total, regardless of whether include_rts is set to false when requesting this resource.\n\nSee Working with Timelines for instructions on traversing timelines.\n\nSee Embedded Timelines, Embedded Tweets, and GET statuses/oembed for tools to render Tweets according to Display Requirements.",
