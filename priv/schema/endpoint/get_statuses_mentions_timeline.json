  "description": "Important notice: On June 19, 2019, we began enforcing a limit of 100,000 requests per day to the /statuses/mentions_timeline endpoint. This is in addition to existing user-level rate limits (75 requests / 15-minutes). This limit is enforced on a per-application basis, meaning that a single developer app can make up to 100,000 calls during any single 24-hour period.\n\nReturns the 20 most recent mentions (Tweets containing a users's @screen_name) for the authenticating user.\n\nThe timeline returned is the equivalent of the one seen when you view your mentions on twitter.com.\n\nThis method can only return up to 800 tweets.\n\nSee Working with Timelines for instructions on traversing timelines.",
