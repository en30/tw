  "description": "Returns a cursored collection of user IDs for every user the specified user is following (otherwise known as their \"friends\").\n\nAt this time, results are ordered with the most recent following first â€” however, this ordering is subject to unannounced change and eventual consistency issues. Results are given in groups of 5,000 user IDs and multiple \"pages\" of results can be navigated through using the next_cursor value in subsequent requests. See Using cursors to navigate collections for more information.\n\nThis method is especially powerful when used in conjunction with GET users / lookup, a method that allows you to convert user IDs into full user objects in bulk.",
